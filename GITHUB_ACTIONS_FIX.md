# üîß GitHub Actions Docker Build Fix

## Problem
The GitHub Actions workflow for testing the production Docker build was failing with this error:

```
docker: Error response from daemon: pull access denied for github-city-generator, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied
```

## Root Cause
The Docker build was completing successfully, but the built image wasn't being loaded into the local Docker daemon. The `docker/build-push-action` was configured with:
- `push: false` - Don't push to registry ‚úÖ
- `load: false` (default) - Don't load into local Docker daemon ‚ùå

This meant the image only existed in the BuildKit cache, not in the local Docker daemon where `docker run` could access it.

## Solution
Added `load: true` to the `docker/build-push-action` configuration:

```yaml
- name: Build production Docker image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    context: .
    file: ./Dockerfile
    push: false
    load: true          # ‚Üê This was the fix!
    tags: github-city-generator:test
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

## Additional Improvements
1. **Better Error Handling**: Added verbose output and error messages to the test script
2. **Container Health Checks**: Added container status and log inspection
3. **More Robust Testing**: Increased wait time and added HTML content validation
4. **Local Test Scripts**: Created `test-docker-local.sh` for local Docker testing

## Test Scripts Created
- `test-production-build.sh` - Tests the build process without Docker
- `test-docker-local.sh` - Tests Docker build when Docker is available
- Updated `test-docker.sh` - Validates all configurations including Docker tests

## Result
‚úÖ GitHub Actions now successfully:
1. Builds the Docker image
2. Loads it into the local Docker daemon
3. Starts a container from the image
4. Tests HTTP endpoints
5. Validates HTML content
6. Cleans up resources

The CI/CD pipeline is now fully functional and ready for production use!
