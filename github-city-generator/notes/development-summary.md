## üöÄ Usage Patterns

### Simple Integration
```typescript
// One-line city generation
const result = await createCityFromGitHubRepo('owner', 'repo', token);
```

### Advanced Control
```typescript
// Full control over the process
const cityGenerator = new CityGenerator(customConfig);
const commits = await fetchAndProcessCommits();
const cityState = await cityGenerator.generateCity(commits);
const geometries = cityGenerator.generateBuildingGeometries();
```

### React Integration
```typescript
// Direct use in React Three Fiber
<Canvas>
  {geometries.map(geometry => 
    <Building key={geometry.id} {...geometry} />
  )}
</Canvas>
```
